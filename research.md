The technology sales industry is quite ruthless. Long hours, hard work and low job security. This is why it is so important to set and achieve your performance goals. The article I have chosen analyzes the use of a portfolio for your goals specifically for students. This can be compared to career life because a portifolio for goals can be used for any goal setting and achievement regardless of the goal. The article looked at students creating a day to day portfolio for student goals to achieve a greater development. The study found that structuring goals in a portfolio setting did enchance student development by a marginal amount. I can apply this structure for my future sales job to achieve my target goals and exceed my quota. To become the overall best sales rep I can be.
